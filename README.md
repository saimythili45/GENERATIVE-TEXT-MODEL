## Text generation is a fascinating application of deep learning in natural language processing (NLP).  we will build a text generation model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks in TensorFlow and Keras.LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to better handle long-term dependencies in sequential data.
